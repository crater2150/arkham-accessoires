# Card trays for Arkham Horror

Various card trays for Arkham Horror, designed for lasercutting 3mm wood panels.
Apart from decorations, these work just as well for other games with similar
card sizes.

## Cutting

Anything not black or with fill instead of outline is intended for engraving,
not cutting. Different colors in the same template are intended to be engraved
at different depths, but should work with same setting too.

If texts differ for german and english edition, both should be included in the
file. Cut only one of them or you'll have to many parts.

## Included Trays

TODO: add photos of finished trays.

### encounter-holder-3x3.svg

A tray for "Encounters in Arkham" cards. Fits 9 decks, so ideal for the base
game. As the large expansions usually add three more decks, I use one for the
base game and a second one with one row for each expansion used.

### encounter-holder-5x2.svg

Previous version of the encounter holder. Fits 10 decks. As the base game uses
nine and each expansion adds more than one, this was not a good fit, but the
additional space can be used to store tokens, e.g. clues.

### itemcard-holder.svg

Holds card decks of the smaller card size. Includes icons for common and unique
items, spells, skills, and allies, but can of course be used for any cards of
that size. Height is set so that playing with lots of expansions should be
possible without overflow.

### mythos-high.svg / otherworld-high.svg

Holders for Mythos deck and Other World encounters deck. Both should be high
enough to be used with any number of expansions, but may be a bit high for only
base game. The two boxes differ only in decoration.
